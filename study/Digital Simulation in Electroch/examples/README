This directory includes a number of modules (in subdirectory modules),
functions and subroutines (in subdirectory subs) and programs using
them (subdirectory progs). All have been tested reasonably thoroughly,
and should work with all permissible input. A description of all
these, beyond what is contained as commentary in the source codes, is
given in Appendix E.

All program work with a precision defined in STUFF.F90 of at least 14
decimal digits.
